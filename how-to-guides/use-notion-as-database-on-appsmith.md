# How to use Notion as a Database on Appsmith

The guide presumes that you are primarily familiar with [Appsmith](https://www.appsmith.com/) and builds further on integrating Appsmith with other tools. In case you don't have much understanding of the core concepts(../core-concepts/connecting-to-data-sources/) of Appsmith, it is recommended to create an account and try applying implementing them.

## Notion

Notion, as the official docs imply, is an application that provides components such as notes, databases, wikis, calendars and reminders. It enables users to connect these components and create their own systems for knowledge management, taking notes, managing data, project management and much more. 

In this guide you will learn to create a Notion Database and use it as a data source in your Appsmith application.
